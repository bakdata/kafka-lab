# kafka-lab

Welcome to the Kafka Lab! In this lab we will walk you through in building a data pipeline using Kafka and Kafka
Streams.
The overall architecture is shown in the picture bellow. This pipeline will read a runners data and cleans/converts
the data and then calculate the average heart rate of the runners in a time window.

Go to each component for more information and implement the code so the test(s) pass! Good luck!
